## 🗑️ Remove a Git tag

### 1️⃣ Delete the tag locally

```bash
git tag -d v1
```

✔ Removes it from your local repo only

---

### 2️⃣ Delete the tag on the remote (GitHub)

```bash
git push origin :refs/tags/v1
```

✔ This is the **actual deletion**
✔ GitHub immediately removes it

---

## 🔍 Verify it’s gone

```bash
git tag
git ls-remote --tags origin
```

---

## 🧠 Common mistake (don’t do this)

```bash
git push origin v1   ❌
```

This **re-pushes** the tag instead of deleting it.

---

## 🔁 Replace a tag (very common in CI)

If you want to **move `v1` to a new commit**:

```bash
git tag -f v1
git push -f origin v1
```

⚠️ Only do this if your team agrees — it rewrites history for consumers.

---

## 🧩 Why this matters for reusable workflows

If someone uses:

```yaml
uses: org/ci-templates/.github/workflows/build.yml@v1
```

Then:

* deleting the tag ❌ will **break their CI**
* moving the tag ⚠️ will **change behavior silently**

So:

* **delete tags** only when fixing mistakes
* **new versions** for real changes

## 🏁 One-line summary

> **Delete locally, then delete remotely — tags are not branches.**

You’re now deep in the “CI as a product” zone 😄
